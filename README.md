# 📐 Geometry Calculator with Java Swing

This is a Java Swing-based desktop application that allows users to calculate the **area**, **perimeter**, **surface area**, and **volume** of various geometric shapes through an interactive GUI. It also visualizes shapes in the console using ASCII art (`*`) where applicable.

## 🖼️ Application Overview

Upon launching the application, a GUI window appears with 5 selectable options:

1. **Rectangle**
2. **Parallelogram**
3. **Rectangular Prism**
4. **Sphere**
5. **Exit**

### 🔸 Features

- 📏 Rectangle and Parallelogram:
  - Input lengths via UI
  - Area and perimeter are calculated dynamically
  - Shape is rendered in the console using `*`

- 📦 Rectangular Prism:
  - Input edge lengths and height via UI
  - Surface area and volume are calculated
  - 3D shape is visualized in the console using `*`

- ⚪ Sphere:
  - Input radius via UI
  - Surface area and volume are calculated
  - No console visualization

- ❌ Exit:
  - Closes the application

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (Graphical User Interface)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ASCII Art (for console rendering)
